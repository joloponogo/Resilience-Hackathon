# VeloSafe

## Description
VeloSafe is an open-source application with the aim of finding the safest route for biking between two points in the city of Zurich.
It is based on OpenStreetMap, MapActivity, and AndroidStudio, which grants it a reproducible character. Among the challenges
faced upon VeloSafe's development, three must be highlighted: acquiring the comprehension around how to extract and work on data
available from OpenStreetMaps, especially the construction of custom weighted graphs from it; the implementation of a
cohesive, user-friendly interface via AndroidStudio; the integration of both back- and front-ends of the feature.

## Documentation
### Frontend
The whole frontend is located in the frontend folder, and is one single project made with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).  
Everything not documented inside the java code was already given by the **"Phone and Tablet" -> "Basic Activity" Template** of Android Studio.
The map service we are using is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), integrated into the code through the [osmdroid library](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/wiki).
